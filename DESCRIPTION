Description: Provides functions and classes to help create Species Distribution 
  Models (SDMs) within the {tidymodels} framework. Provides new {parsnip} models,
  new {recipes} steps, and {yardstick} metrics. This package provides access to the 
  powerful {tidymodels} ecosystem for SDMs, especially the package {spatialsample} 
  for spatially aware cross validation and model evaluation, as well as opening 
  up all classification models implemented in {parsnip} for presence-only SDMs,
  using the pseudo-absence approach.
